 ****************************************
 RUN MANAGEMENT UNDERTAKEN USING BEOPEST.
 COMMUNICATIONS PROTOCOL = TCP.
 ****************************************
 

 BEOPEST was either not able to find a run management file in the current
 working directory or did not find a value for PARLAM in that file.

 PARLAM has been assigned a value of 1. Hence Marquardt lambda search runs 
 will be parallelized.
